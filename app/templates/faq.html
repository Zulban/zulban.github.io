<h1>FAQ</h1>
<h3>What's a hackathon?</h3>
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon">hackathon</a> is a design sprint-like event in which computer programmers, graphic designers, interface designers, project managers, and others, often including domain experts, collaborate intensively on software projects. Usually a hackathon takes place over just a few days.</p>
<p>Many hackathon projects are abandoned or never submitted. Thatâ€™s okay! Hackathons are about experimentation, learning, making fast prototypes, and meeting new people.</p>
<p>Hackathons have mentors and experts to help participants, and a panel of judges to choose the winners.</p>
<h3>What tools can I use?</h3>
<p>You can use any software tool or programming languages for your submission. It is recommended that you use open source tools, open standards, and cross platform solutions. This makes it easier for teams to work together, and for everyone to see your project results first-hand.</p>
<h3>What is the format of the product participants will deliver?</h3>
<p>To be considered for any prizes, each team must submit:</p>
<ul>
<li>A 5 minute video showing and explaining your project. </li>
<li>A public link to your code, like a GitLab or GitHub link.</li>
</ul>
<p>Good to note:</p>
<ul>
<li>If a video longer than 5 minutes is submitted, judges may watch just the first 5 minutes.</li>
<li>You can check if your link is public by opening an incognito/private window in your web browser and visiting your URL.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Who owns the intellectual property?</h3>
<p>All participants keep the intellectual property rights for all the code they've written. However to be considered for prizes, your code must be shared publicly.</p>
<h3>How will the judging work?</h3>
<p>Step 1: After the submission deadline, all projects will be reviewed by one judge to check if they meet the minimum submission criteria, eliminating those that don't. If the omission seems trivial and the project has merit, we will contact the group to fix the submission.</p>
<p>Step 2: A technical judge will review the project code and write a short report for the other judges. The report includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>How much original code was likely written specifically for this event.</li>
<li>Languages, tools, systems, APIs, and data that was meaningfully used in the project.</li>
<li>Likelihood of blatant plagiarism.</li>
<li>Quality of code and technical documentation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Step 3: At least three judges will view the submission video, review the project files, and read the report from step 2. Each judge awards the project with a score using the grading rubric that was shared when the challenge was announced.</p>
<p>Step 4: The rubric scores are not final. A majority of judges agree on the winners using the rubric scores as a guide.</p>
<h3>Who can attend?</h3>
<p>Anyone in the world can attend and submit projects! However there are conditions for the cash prizes.</p>

<ul>
<li>A Canadian citizen or permanent resident.</li>
<li>Not a public servant.</li>

<h3>Can non-Canadians win cash prizes?</h3>
<p>No. Although, groups that mix Canadians and non-Canadians can win cash prizes, except the group must be at least half Canadian and the prize money will only be sent to them.</p>
<h3>Can public servants win cash prizes?</h3>
<p>No.</p>
<h3>Is this event free?</h3>
